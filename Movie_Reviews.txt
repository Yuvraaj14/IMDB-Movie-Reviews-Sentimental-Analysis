Great execution and performances but writing is average!
Just watched "Raayan", marks Dhanush's second directorial venture, where he excels in both execution and performance. The meticulously choreographed action sequences offer a visual treat, AR Rahman's music elevates the tension in this modern action-thriller. However, the writing department seemed to have large room for improvement, particularly in the conflicts between brothers, which feel lackluster, the villain arc, especially for a performer like SJ Surya, seemed underdeveloped, diminishing the overall impact the story could have delivered, making the film a one-time watch for its impressive performances and technical brilliance.

Failed to hit the target
The cast, production and all technical aspects are perfect. But failed to connect the character and emotion to audience with the writings. The sentiment sequences, action blocks are crafted very well, but as a WHOLE movie it failed miserably. Looks like all characters are in confused state in second half. There are lot of decisions taken by character just to move the story towards climax, in real/cinematic life no one will do such actions/decisions.
Compared to this second half, the first half was better. Even the great interval block failed to give goosebumps, as that block is so illogical. Failed to impress, even if you lower your expectations.

Good Action Entertainer
Second half could've been better but Dhanush still managed to give a decent entertainer. The rivalry between SJ Surya and Dhanush felt weak, Dhanush could've definitely added some depth to the storyline between the both of them. Good thing that they didn't get a pair for Dhanush like any other typical Tamil movie. First half was very good, every characters had a role and everyone acted well. AR Rahman's songs and BGM was brilliant. Interval scene was very well made kudos to Dhanush and team. Adangatha Asuran song was a visual treat. Congratulations to Dhanush and team. Overall a good action entertainer, great choice for a 50th movie. Hope Dhanush continues his directional career.

When there is Nothing New, But the excecution exceeds that is "RAAYAN"
The most thing for any film is how you keep the audience hooked for a 2hr 30min film, And dhanush did that in his own way. Even with a very normal story and the exceptional excecution the film quite well in some parts. Though there were so many faults, but the performance manages to clear all those defaults. Important thing is Music. Even with a very normal story and the exceptional excecution the film quite well in some parts. Though there were so many faults, but the performance manages to clear all those defaults. And dhanush did that in his own way. Overall a good movie, which we can watch with zero expectations.

Wow! I just came out from watching an early screening of Raayan at the AMC 25 in Times Square. This movie exceeded all my expectations! The slums and the several gang, police and civilian story lines coalescing brilliantly reminded me of Brazil's City of God. The revenge plot, the incredibly choreographed action sequences, and the nighttime glistening chromatic scenes reminded me of John Wick. The movie clocks in at around 2hrs and 30mins. By the 90 minute mark I started thinking that the movie might become flat because it seems like all plot lines have been fully explored and the race to the ending would be a long-stretched, stereotypical one, but something happens that completely shifts the entire movie in a new direction. That something brought back feelings of rage and sorrow akin to Japan's Akira, where you are left speechless and empty at how things wound up the way they did. For us westerners that grimace at the thought of a dance scene popping up in the middle of the scene, don't panic. There are only two major dance scenes in the movie that last around 5 minutes each, both of which fit in very well with the movie by conveying the emotions and forcefulness of their particular timestamps; the second dance scene was in particular potent and mesmerizing, nothing of a corney dance spectacle you might have seen in a YT Bollywood scene. This movie and Kill have been the biggest movie surprises this year for me. It has certainly opened my mind to Indian films, and I can't wait to see more movies of this calibre.

Terrific Masterpiece. What a movie, it was just phenomenal.
Dhanush's performance deserves an Oscar award, he literally lived in the character. He's co-artists did very well there jobs. Every character arc is special and scores on screen.
Technically it's strong solid movie. Art work, costume designer, colors and tonnes, music and background score, stunts and action sequences were absolutely stunning The screen-play was slow a first but took jet speed after. Moreover the interval and climax are pure goospumps. Pre-Interval, Interval, Pre-Climax and Climax were terrifically banging Despite some few lags which are not disturbing, this movie is for sure a millstone in Dhanush's carrier and in Indian Cinema. D's 50th film won. A must watch masterpiece.

Raayan! A DHANUSH DHAMAKKA
The movie revolves around same revenge and a family based storyline. But D as director making this film is commendable. The cinematography is well appreciated and loved by most. The camera angles were excellent. And as usual the SJ SURYA vibe was brought into the screen. But the storyline is not that great and the BGMs are an absolute masterpiece. In the film, D doesn't have lot many dialogues but him expressing it with just his eyes was just stunning. A good film to watch and no moral outcome from the film to be gained. Watch it as a film and enjoy. Some critics may have a different opinion, but this is what I feel.

Could have been a great one
Well... it's a near perfect first half. Brilliant screen play, fantastic lighting ... shots in the rain ... a great "bhramaugam" movie style clean black and white sequences ... and a super. Back ground score... And then comes the second half .. It clearly feels like the people who wrote, directed, scored and sequenced the action scenes were thrown away and a whole other crew was got in to finish the second half... In fact it is so weirdly bad that I would give 8 to the first half and give 2 to the second ... hence the 5 rating. With so many good brains behind the movie, it's surprising that none of them caught all the bad sides of the second half during the editing and pre-screening process.

Raayan, An intriguing family drama with stunning action sequences portraying betrayal over brotherhood. The movie revolves around Kaathavarayan & his 3 siblings who accidentally gets involved in a feud between two gangster groups in the town and how Kaathavarayan protects his family from these gangsters forms the story. Dhanush's stone faced portrayal of Kaathavarayan resembles the bitter experiences and hardships he has faced in bringing up his family in young age holds justice to his character arc. Dhanush has marvelled in the role of both the director as well as a performer on screen. Poignant performances by Selvaraghavan,Dushara Vijayan,Sundeep Kishan,Kalidas & Aparna Balamurali. Dhanush has perfectly metaphorised Dushara's action sequences with the Lord Durga Devi. S J Surya's performance as an antagonist opposite Dhanush was unmatchable and outstanding. Splendid action sequences throughout and excellent cinematography by Om Prakash. Good writing by Dhanush & Raayan is definitely an exceptional watch in theatres.

"Raayan" - D50 - Astounds from a technical perspective
"Raayan" astounds from a technical perspective, utilizing impeccable camera angles, lighting, panning, and backdrops that beautifully intertwine with the story. Dhanush's capabilities are magnificently showcased in his 50th film, depicting an emotional evolution from calmness to aggression with sheer brilliance. The cast delivers stellar performances, embodying all the navarasas with finesse. Selvaraghavan and Dushara's mind-blowing screen presence leaves a lasting impact. SJ Surya and Prakash Raj, as always, bring their exceptional talents to the forefront. Sundeep, Aparna, and Kalidas's acting further complement the film, making it more thrilling and interesting. A truly remarkable cinematic experience that highlights the best of storytelling and technical prowess.

Same story seen many times with a different angle
Tamil cinema had seen numerous gangster making movies or like normal person to being a gangster. A. R. Rahaman Music, Dhanush performance, screenplay, Dhanush doesn't where is needs to go in the second half, SJ suryah is not a right person Like the Audience are hungry searching for Briyani,Fried Rice, Full non-veg meals finally settled for chapathi..
We have seen many movies like this Bhagavathi, Thirupathichi, Thotti jaya of charters revolving around the families. Same as that on a different angle. One time watchable.. It would be good experience on theaters not on OTT.

Stellar performance of Dhanush Fitting into Raayan's Shoes
Directed by Dhanush starring Dhanush in the lead role. Also starring S. J. Suryah, Prakash Raj, Selvaraghavan, Sundeep Kishan, Kalidas Jayaram, Dushara Vijayan, Aparna Balamurali. An emotional vengeance with stellar performance of Dhanush. Writer Dhanush talks about the emotional bond of the siblings which later develops an act of betrayal and vengeance. Had we not seen such of story, yes, we had but what makes Raayan watchable is the journey the Dhanush built up to narrate the story. Talking about the performance, an intense Dhanush can be witnessed. The character who is rigid, does not express emotions but he is soft when he is with his sister, the variations of his emotions, writer - director Dhanush able to extract well from actor Dhanush. Initial of the movie shows the childhood of the Raayan family wherein the journey of their childhood, unforeseen circumstances which substantiate the Raayan's present behaviour. Sundeep Kishan & Kalidas Jayaram playing as younger siblings have performance driven moments in the second half. Dushara Vijayan portraying the sister's role had given a terrific performance & her too performance was witnessed in the second half as the story itself start to escalate in the second half. SJ Suryah as the antagonist. For him, it is now a cat walk when comes to performing an antagonist role & he nailed the character. Coming to the technical aspect, actions were classy. A needle kind of tool to pounce at Raayan's enemies, choreography was well executed. The fight before the interval block was top notch. ARR BGM added the life to the vengeance story telling. Cinematography was another positive factor. Metaphor of using colour red depicting the bloodshed, Dushara Vijayan character name is Durga & how this name signifies her character, shadow of Raavan when Raayan ascending towards its foe here all director able to convince the audience very well. Overall Raayan a watchable flick thereby removing the fatigue of watching Indian 2.

Worst movie made only to glorify violence sans brotherhood
A really pointless and senseless movie only taken to show violence irrespective of kiths and kins, brother or sister...no logic in the most weakest story.. Indian movies , tamil movies need more emotions which can sell like 96.. This is completely in the opposite genre of showing emotions on paper and ending with no emotions ... Very very poor screenplay for the pointless story .. Weak plots for revenge for all characters... Disappointed with SJ SURYAH acting and no meaning in some characters like prakashraj or aparna or kalidas...very boring watch and will not even return to see on OTT.. Worst album from Rahman and poor background score in the emotional or fight scenes... Selvaraghavan was the only character which had some meaning and he did his job well... 100 crores all everything will be nonsense for this movie but producers could still show KNIFE to make people watch spending money.

Perfect casting and the making choices save this Dhanush directorial.
Raayan is the eldest brother who becomes the protector of his three siblings, after the parents go missing. He escapes the child trafficker and all four run away, making Raayan in-charge of raising his three siblings. He takes up the fatherly responsibilities. Muthu and Manickam are the kind of brothers, who see fatherly figure in Raayan but have a tighter bond with each other. The youngest is Durga and Raayan lives for her, causing a bit of jealousy among the brothers. Elsewhere, two rival dons are at each other's throats but are maintaining "peace" for now which the police commissioner wants to disrupt over his personal grudge. What happens when Raayan and his siblings get caught in between this trap and will the antagonists stand a chance to survive once Raayan gets unleashed, forms rest of the story. I am quite reserved when it comes to gangster films and this one has a thin story. The strength lies in the characterization of these 4 main characters and how well the parallels are drawn with Raavana. The glorification of Raavana via Raayan is top notch. The narrative has a smooth flow in the first half with Dhanush in full control of his craft. All the characters get established well with right amount of hero build up till the interval bang. A. R. Rahman's music adds another layer and half the battle is already won with the casting. Having said that, it is the second half which loses it's steam with the story getting all too predictable and Dhanush relying on heavy violence. The placement and picturization of Adangada Asuran song was an interesting choice. Overall, Raayan has a good first half and an okay second half, thanks to the perfect casting, it ends up as a one time watch.

Movie was awesome. But some lag in this movie as per story is super. And A.r.rahman killed it. Dhanush performance,direction and writings also perfect. And all actors are did it well. And sundeep Kishan takes big role in this film. But one thing we will predict the story easily. Action scenes was marvelous. He works mainly on explanation. And especially actress who play the role as raayan's sister is did well. And in telugu varalaxmi's dubbing artist were changed. And prakash raj plays good role in this film. And sj surya plays negative role in this film. My rating is 8.3 for this movie. All the best for all the crew and actors.

The supporting cast also delivers powerful performances, each adding depth and nuance to the film's rich tapestry. The film's technical aspects are equally impressive. The cinematography is visually stunning, capturing the essence of the story with breathtaking shots and captivating visuals. The background score, composed by the legendary A. R.

Great Direction. It's crime action movie.
The every part of the movie was great. Direction, musician, the scenes when the action took part in streets at dark. Overall was a great action crime movie. The storyline is totally gives us a horror vibe, but if u couldn't accept the storyline because it's ended in very bad storyline of brotherhood, u guys should think about our mahabharata story. Dhanush sir brings out every characters act so naturally. Hope he'll continue direct more movies after this. The movie was not for everyone because everyone's mind thinking is different. But, if u are into the movies like a happy family ending, I don't recommend this movie for u. But, if u are an open minded person, yes, u'll enjoy and understand about this movie. Again I was mesmerised by dhanush sir acting skills, he's the one and only indian actor who can act naturally in a character giving some pyscho vibe. And always love him for his dancing skill and action skill. Hope he's continues directing and acting in more great movies.

An average first half and Worst second half sj surya should be used properly and the dialogues are very poor screen play is below average and there is loop whole is this movie overall it is a bad flim.

Don't waste your money for one song which is also screwed in movie
This movie is a joke.. 1st half of the movie was ok it was also a bit slow but i thought the 2nd half will fire up but noo 2nd half is the worst part.. ARR bgm scores were great, dhanush, Sundeep Kishan, S. J. Suryah, Selvaraghavan provided best acting especially Selvaraghavan given his lifetime best performance as an actor.. I don't know what happened to Varalaxmi Sarathkumar's face and she did appear for 4 or 5 scenes she did her best but the movie failed to entertain. Dhanush destroyed his own 50th movie by Directing this movie.. Don't waste your money for one song which is also screwed in movie.

Dhanush is a Monster
Recently, I watched a film that truly left me speechless. Every aspect of it, from direction to performances, was executed with such artistry that it made a lasting impact.
Dhanush stands at the heart of this extraordinary film. His performance is mesmerizing, embodying his character with intensity and authenticity. Dhanush transforms into a force of nature, proving himself a true master of his craft. His dedication and versatility make him one of the most compelling actors of our time. The film's gripping narrative, impeccable direction, stunning cinematography, and resonant soundtrack create an unforgettable experience. This is not just a movie; it's an experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Dhanush's performance is a tour de force, and I wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece to every film enthusiast.

2/10
The first half was soo good. Fight scenes were great. Camera work was also good. All the characters acting was also up to the mark. In the interval me and my brother felt like it is going to be another Vikiram level hit movie. Second half was too booring. No strong reason anywhere why people are killing each other. I think even the writers were confused how to end the story. Few audience laughed at a emotional serious scene because there was no reason backing. Felt like someone ruined a good story and made a film out of it. I don't think I'll recommend anyone because I'll be wasting their time.

Average action flick with template storytelling
Raayan - Good casting,setwork and staging but none of them standout well due to poor writing. Twists,emotional connections and reason for the revenge are far from impressive and looks silly. Decent performance by all the artist and good technical work but in overall Raayan is just a disappointment. Wondering what Dhanush saw in this script and decided to go with it for 50th milestone movie. Raayan also had resemblance of many action movies like Vada Chennai , Subramaniapuram , Pudhupettai etc . But all those movies had strong background for the revenge and good emotional connect which gave us a satisfaction. Raayan failed to leave us with that satisfaction.

Must watch Masterpiece
This film is excellent.
Technically it's a strong movie : acting stunts, dance choreography, cinematography, color grading, screenplay are top noch. Dhanush played really well in this movie. He knew how to manipulate emotions and deliver them without overdoing it. The songs are amazing. My favorite album of this year without a doubt. After a long time ARR is back with banging scores. Everyone played their role very well. Their character arc is well written and each actor shines on screen. It's just magic. The movie is emotionally connecting and the villain character is very powerful. The face-off between D and SJ Surya is terrific. Dhanush is shining as a director. I loved it and you absolutely must see this movie.

Simply extraordinary. Great experience.
The story line is nothing new but that said the experience is new. The play of emotions is very well handled. Songs and background score both are great. This elevates the experience in theatre for sure. Dhanush has done brilliantly in both departments - acting and direction. Yes, the movie has violence and blood shed but it is not that vulgar and is very much watchable for all kinds of audience. The stunt is great. The intensity of dhanush acting is unmatched. The story execution is well balanced with no obvious flaws or loopholes. It's an experience in theatre. The songs are sure to stay with you for some time and you would start appreciating Dhanush for his work. I wonder how come sun pictures get to produce all movies. I travelled 100+ kms to watch it in theatre and it was worth it. We all enjoyed it.

Cult Classic
Dhanush sir writing, acting and direction is awesome... I loved each bit of it... Dhanush as a responsible brother, protected his sister and brothers and the care is >>>> Loved the movie... Please everyone watch the movie with your siblings. Action sequences are more but the situation needed it the most .. no unnecessary drama and ARR music is Touched.... Dhanush sir's Acting i couldn't express it in my words.. As always awesome. One thing I must mention is., Hero and Villain's dance at the claimax gives goosebumps.. The real definition of Brother's love is this movie I think. The frames of some of the scenes we won't forget. Overall awesome movie... Please don't spread negativity. Watch it with your siblings.

A solid movie
All the characters has justify what has given by the director. Technically and colour grading movie was wonderful. Even though dhanush was director he didn't overuse the power and portray his character with punch dialogue and etc. His character , sundeep kishan , Dushara, kalidass jayaram and Sj suryah have nailed their character. First half really set the tone and mood of the film . With introducing all the character. How the police are looking at the crime are happening in the city and why they are focusing it. ( Could have explain what dhanush did 10 years back ) . Second was really seat edge screenplay with dushara had given extraordinary performance. The Adangatha Asuran colour grading and visual was superb. A lot to praise in this movie for dhanush being a wonderful director to pull out an extraordinary performance on all the actors. WORTH WATCHING IN THEATER.

8/10
Violent but sensible movie! Not for everyone...
It's worth watching. Certainly it is not a bad movie. Maybe we can say it failed to meet the gold standard bcoz of some logic issues but the movie is definitely good. For those who grew up in apartments or in a calm place or in Porsche areas or even in peaceful rural areas, this movie will be a distant reality that they cannot relate to... If you have seen the original Chennai (North Chennai), you will understand the harsh truth of the lives shown in this movie. And I always fall for sister sentiment. This movie has loads of it. It cannot still match the Basha sister sentiment fight scene. Do not believe on the negative reviews. Dhanush is inspired by Vetrimaaran and we can definitely see that in this movie.
If violence in movie is not your cup of tea, you wouldn't like this movie. For the rest, it's a good film to watch.

A movie which could be written well
Raayan The movie was surprisingly good and felt a feast for d fans and general audience. It had a great casting but failed to use their potential. First half felt decent and had a banger interval with those fight scenes. But the second half didn't worked out due to its weak writing and logical loops. Villan Character seemed to be weak and it doesn't had a strong base on story. D should have used the full potential of SJ but he failed. After all ARR was the biggest plus of the movie. Music elevated the movie to next level. Twist and turns didn't worked well that was a major disadvantage and could have written well. Other than that Other actors acting was good and choreography was excellent Frames and screenplay was decent. Unwanted characters and weak writing made the film to be an average one.

8/10
Evolved commercial flim
Raayan is a complete action commercial movie which contains lot of performers and strong technical team, lot of reviews mentioning about lagging second half, but if you connect to the movie you won't feel like that, obviously strong reason for revenge is missing and lot of non logic loopholes in story but overall it never fails to impress us in execution, fight portions, BGM's and slow mo shots are huge plus point, if you enjoy slow paced brutal action movies you will like this, it breaks the usual commercial flimsy logics and gave us the good theatrical experience, there are two types of action lovers, Guns and Knifes, how the first type people likes vikram second half like the same way the Knife category will like second half of Raayan, At least story is moving in second half (Not like some other so called over hyped action commercial movies) Overall Raayan = Rage.

8/10
Another Great Movie in the list of Dhanush. He proved a great talent in directing and writing this movie. Cast is great but their roles in the movie are not up to their range. Yes! His Performance and His Direction was great in the movie. But as a writer he failed in delivering a great Climax. The People who deserve great roles didn't receive, which has to be noted. The Girl who had great part in the second half performed really brilliant. Genuine Review. And its really a good film which can be watched twice and more as a fan and film lover. The Great Cast like Prakash Raj, Aparna Balamurali, Even SJ Suryah doesn't have great roles and not used as great chearcters. Dushara Vijayan and Sandeep Kishan was highly used and they are great at their roles. Potentiality of Selva Raghavan is also not used well.

10/10
Exceptionally good
The film was very captivating . Its after very long in tamil cinema that we get to see a movie where all the characters have a role and the main lead doesnt have a heroine. Wonderful direction. Music has played a huge role in making the scenes more captivating. The movie is not agenda driven. It is mainly based on the challenges Faced by the main lead as the eldest brother of the family. Dhushara's acting skills have been potrayed really well in this film compared to what the actress had done in her previous films. Also contemporary actors like kalidas and sandeep have been able to bring out their acting skills well. As an audience I really hope dhanush excels as a director and brings more mega hit films to the box office.

10/10
a Must watch film in Dhanush Career
Well from the beginning to end the movie steels your time, the way director dhanush keeps you with the movie line is really good. Ofcourse every actor from the crew have done a fantastic job. The movie has good thrill scenes like adhukalam and asuran. The movie takes you with many twist in 2nd half. Is it worth to see this movie 2 hr 25 minutes- Every minute is worth. The plus was Ar rahman sir bgm and the music level which makes the movie go smooth. Sj suryah has always good in doing his role, 10/10 for his acting. Its a family movie - No bad scenes, specially this is a family entertainment movie.

One Of The best Tamil films of 2024
Well done to Dhanush for making one of the best Tamil films I think of 2024. This is his first film that he has directed and written and boy he has down a very good job. His acting for me has always been amazing and his emotions throughout the film was amazing. All actors and actress were good to. The story focus on Dhanush and his siblings with twists as you carry on watching. The first part of the movie has a very good story and is watchable. We see Dhanush and how smart he is and how he looks after his siblings. Dhanush acts as Raayan who is the eldest of his siblings and at a very young age, he has looked after them especially his sister. They live a normal life until their lives have turned upside down. The second part of the film is very entertaining with lots of good fight scenes. Amala Paul who acts as Dhanush sister in the film was amazing too, we see how her character changes. S. J. Suryah who once again plays the bad guy was amazing. Overall I love this film, 5/5 & 10/10. I love the fight scenes, the story and the twist in this movie. Please go and watch this film if you are a Dhanush fan. This film has a very good decent story and lots of action/fight scenes.
